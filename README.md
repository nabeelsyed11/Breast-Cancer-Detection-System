## ✅ Overview  
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. **Early diagnosis can significantly improve recovery chances.**  

This project leverages **machine learning** to classify breast tumors into **benign** or **malignant**, helping in medical diagnostics research.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, which contains features computed from digitized images of a **fine needle aspirate (FNA)** of breast masses.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, etc.)  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation  
The models were evaluated using:  
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
- ROC-AUC Curve  

---

## 🎯 Results  
The models achieved **high accuracy (97%+ depending on the algorithm).**  
- **Random Forest** and **SVM** performed particularly well, making them strong candidates for assisting medical diagnostics.  

⚠️ *Note: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used in real-world diagnostics without proper clinical validation.*
