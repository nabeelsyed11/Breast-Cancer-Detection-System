✅ Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the chances of recovery. This project leverages machine learning to assist in the classification of tumors into benign or malignant categories.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

🔗 UCI ML Repository – Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, etc.)

📈 Model Evaluation
The following metrics were used to evaluate model performance:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

ROC-AUC Curve

🎯 Results
The model achieved high accuracy (e.g., 97%+ depending on the algorithm). Random Forest and SVM performed especially well, making this a strong candidate for assisting medical diagnostics.

⚠️ Note: This project is educational and should not be used in real-world diagnostics without proper clinical validation.
